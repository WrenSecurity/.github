We are a community-driven initiative that develops a complete open-source solution for identity and access management. Our suite provides tools for secure authentication, authorization, and single sign-on, as well as identity storage, lifecycle automation, auditing, and more. 

Our projects are based on the latest code from ForgeRockâ„¢, just before they stopped releasing their software under an open-source license.
